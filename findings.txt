Lab 1: Read Source


1. Compiler: GCC (C/C++ compiler) (Github link: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc)


It appears that at the topmost level: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/gcc is the directory containing all parts of the compiler for multiple aspect of GCC.

Do we include headers as well?

3. What was the most ridiculous thing you found? (funny comments? awful code?)


How old is this TODO!?: 
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/c/c-parser.c

Has a shouldn't happen comment: 
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libcpp/expr.c

"
/* This source file contains "main" for the compiler driver.
   All of the real work is done within gcc.c; we implement "main"
   in here for the "gcc" binary so that gcc.o can be used in
   libgccjit.so.  */

4. Take notes along the way (if you find something that’s unrelated to a compiler phase, try to infer what it’s doing).

Array notation in C:
